# Hamiltonian Ergodic Inference
This is the demo code of gradient-based tuning of HMC hyperparameters for better posterior inference in VAE.

## Requirement
To run this demo code, you need the following python package installed
- Python 3.5 (python 3 is necessary, but not exact version)
- Tensorflow 1.5.0 (GPU support is optional, but strongly recommended)
- Numpy 1.14
- Matplotlib 2.1.0
